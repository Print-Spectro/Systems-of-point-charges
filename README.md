# Systems-of-point-charges
There is a python file that contains the code, running the code in jupyter notebook is recommended for making plots.
The python file contains code for storing charge objects with their position in space and their charge. This includes code to define molecular geometries that you can then rotate and translate in space. There are then methods that one can use to return the potential and the electric field at a point in space, and the total potential energy of the system when moving the charges in from infinity.
